# Postmortem Report: Unexpected Siesta of Web Application

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** February 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 16, 2024, 1:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Our web application took an unexpected siesta, leaving users scratching their heads and refreshing their browsers like it's the digital equivalent of tapping the snooze button.
- **Root Cause:** Our database connection pool decided it needed a vacation too, thanks to a misconfiguration in the application server.

## Timeline:
- **February 15, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC):** Our monitoring system started blaring like a car alarm at 3 AM, alerting us to increased latency and error rates.
- **February 15, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC):** Engineering team gets a rude awakening from the alert and springs into action faster than a cat hearing a can opener.
- **February 15, 2024, 10:45 AM (UTC):** We dove into the logs and metrics like detectives on a case of missing bytes.
- **February 15, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC):** Initially thought it was a code deployment gone rogue, so we attempted a rollback. Spoiler alert: the code wasn't the culprit.
- **February 15, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC):** Incident escalated to the database administration team.
- **February 15, 2024, 5:00 PM (UTC):** Database admins identified the misconfiguration causing connection pool exhaustion.
- **February 15, 2024, 6:30 PM (UTC):** Adjusted database connection pool settings.
- **February 15, 2024, 8:00 PM (UTC):** Application servers restarted to apply configuration changes.
- **February 16, 2024, 1:00 AM (UTC):** Service fully restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration in the application server led to database connection pool exhaustion.
- **Resolution:** Adjusted database connection pool settings to accommodate higher traffic.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  1. Implement automated testing of database connection pool configurations.
  2. Enhance monitoring and alerting systems for early detection.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Update documentation with clear guidelines on configuring database connection pools.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of server configurations.
  3. Schedule regular performance testing and capacity planning sessions.
  4. Hold a post-incident review to learn from mistakes.

With these changes, we'll be better prepared to handle future challenges and maybe even sneak in a few extra coffee breaks along the way.
